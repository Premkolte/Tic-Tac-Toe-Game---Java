Tic Tac Toe Game Mini-Project Report

Project Overview:
=> The Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player, turn-based board game implemented in Java, where players take turns marking cells on a grid. The game includes both single-player and multi-player modes, offering various advanced features such as AI opponents, dynamic board sizes, and more.

Features:
1. Multiplayer Mode:
•  Players can play against each other on the same device. They take turns marking the grid with ‘X’ and ‘O’ until a winner is determined or the board is full.
2. Single-Player Mode with AI:
•  Players can compete against a basic AI. The AI is implemented using a random move generator for beginners and can be enhanced with the Minimax algorithm for smarter moves.
3. Custom Board Size:
• Players can choose from various board sizes (e.g., 4x4, 5x5). The win condition adapts to the size, requiring a certain number of consecutive marks to win.
4. Win Condition Check:
• The game automatically checks for horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of consecutive marks to determine the winner.
5. Restart Option:
• Players can restart the game after it ends, resetting the board without restarting the program.
6. Replay Game Animation:
• The sequence of moves is stored during gameplay and replayed with animation after the game finishes.
7. Game Progress Display:
• The board is updated and displayed after each move, allowing players to track the game’s progress.

Technologies Used:
	•	Programming Language: Java
	•	Algorithms: Minimax (with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimized AI moves)
	•	UI: Command Line Interface (CLI)

Future Improvements:
	•	Add difficulty levels for the AI (easy, medium, hard).
	•	Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive user experience.
	•	Add multiplayer support over a network.

Conclusion:
The Tic Tac Toe game integrates advanced features such as AI, customisable board sizes, and game replay functionality, making it a comprehensive and engaging project. Adding a replay animation and an intuitive restart option enhances the user experience. The AI’s efficiency and the dynamic nature of the board size offer exciting challenges for players of all levels.
